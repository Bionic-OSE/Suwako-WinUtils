# Suwako Debloater
A simple tool that **purges UWP apps** (and optionally along with Edge and OneDrive) from your system. Simple, easily configurable, does what's said, and aims towards being a tool that you can just set and forget having to deal with consequences later.  
This tool suits for newly installed Windows systems, where its goal is to give you the lightest fresh start possible. Running this on an already-set up system will **remove ALL UWP apps that you have installed!**
